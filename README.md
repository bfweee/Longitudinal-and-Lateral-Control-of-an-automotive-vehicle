# Longitudinal-and-Lateral-Control-of-a-vehicle
This repository contains the Matlab code for the lateral and longitudinal control of vehicle modeled based on the  Bicycle-Model. This work was  carried out by me and my colleague Suleyman as part of the smart transportation course. 

This Project deals with the longitudinal and lateral control of an automotive vehicle within the
framework of fully automated guidance. The automotive vehicle is a complicated system with
nonlinear longitudinal and lateral coupled dynamics. As a result, automated guidance must be
performed in conjunction with longitudinal and lateral control. In this lab, we examine a model
predictive control-based automated steering technique. To deal with the longitudinal speed
tracking problem, a longitudinal control technique is also proposed. Finally, a unified longitudinal
and lateral control strategy helps to improve the combined control performance. This whole control
strategy is tested through simulations showing the effectiveness of the present approach.
