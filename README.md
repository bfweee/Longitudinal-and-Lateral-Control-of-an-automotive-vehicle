# Longitudinal-and-Lateral-Control-of-a-vehicle

This Project deals with the longitudinal and lateral control of an automotive vehicle within the
framework of fully automated guidance. The automotive vehicle is a complicated system with
nonlinear longitudinal and lateral coupled dynamics. As a result, automated guidance must be
performed in conjunction with longitudinal and lateral control. In this lab, we examine a model
predictive control-based automated steering technique. To deal with the longitudinal speed
tracking problem, a longitudinal control technique is also proposed. Finally, a unified longitudinal
and lateral control strategy helps to improve the combined control performance. This whole control
strategy is tested through simulations showing the effectiveness of the present approach.
